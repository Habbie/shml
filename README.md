clistrap
========

Clistrap is a command-line interface style framework for faster and easier shell script development.

**Please Note**: This is a work in progress, naming conventions will change.  Also feel free to contribute by making a pull request.

## Why

HTML has CSS, CLI has "ANSI/VT100 Control Sequences".  Clistrap makes is easy to apply some style to your shell scripts without trying to remember that Yellow = `\033[33m` instead Yellow is `cs_f_yellow`. If you couldn't tell, Clistrap is heavily inspired by [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).

## What

Run `./example.sh` for examples.

## Dev

Run tests with `make`.
