`SHML` is a shell framework for faster and easier script development.

## Why
HTML has CSS, terminals have `ANSI/VT100 Control Sequences`. SHML makes is easy to apply some style to your shell scripts without trying to remember that `Yellow = \033[33m` instead Yellow is `$(color yellow)`.

$ sh -c "curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxcdn/shml/master/shml.sh -o /usr/local/bin/shml && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/shml"
```
## Run

$ shml "$(color yellow)Couldn't peep it with a pair of ðŸ‘“$(color end)"
```
`Couldn't peep it with a pair of ðŸ‘“`
